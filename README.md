This document provides instructions for setting up and running a live score web application that utilizes the LiveScore6 API (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/livescore6) for fetching live sports data.

Requirements:

Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
A RapidAPI account and API key for LiveScore6
Getting Started:

Clone or Download the Code:

You can either clone the code repository (if provided) or download the provided code files.
The code should include:
index.html: Main HTML file for the application.
style.css: Stylesheet for the web app's visual design.
script.js: JavaScript code for functionality like fetching scores, displaying data, and managing favorites.
Obtain a RapidAPI Key:

Create a free account on RapidAPI (https://rapidapi.com).
Search for the LiveScore6 API and subscribe to a free plan (if available).
Obtain your API key from the RapidAPI dashboard.
Configure API Key:

Open the script.js file and locate the following lines:

JavaScript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY'; // Replace with your actual API key
const host = 'apidojo.com'; // Host for LiveScore6 API
Use code with caution.
Replace YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY with your actual API key obtained from RapidAPI.

Run the App:

Open the index.html file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
The web app should display live scores based on the default settings.
